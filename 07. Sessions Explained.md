1. When you do `req.session.userId = user.id`, you store data into redis

2. Redis is a key/value paire data store. Redis will assign a key to this object, something like `sess:qhshdjkashdh -> { userId: 1 }`

3. `express-session` will set a cookie on my browser, cookie value is something like `daksjhdkjahdkjahs`. It is signed version of the redis key ``sess:qhshdjkashdh`,

4. when user makes a request, this cookie value will be sent to the version. Server will decrypt this value with `secret`, and get the key of the redis key `sess:qhshdjkashdh`

5. make request to redis, lookup the key `sess:qhshdjkashdh`, and get saved value > { userId: 1 }
